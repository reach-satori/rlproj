This is quite an old project that I worked on when I was first getting into programming seriously, around 2017 sometime. Something about roguelikes quite appeals to me and they're complex enough to give me a good challenge: it represented a HUGE boost in learning done in a short time when I did it.
I've repeated the process once since, with c++, with similar learning results.


I'm putting it up because there's no reason not to. I understood nothing of modules, or organization, or anything at all, and the mess is clear to see. I doubt anyone else would care but it's of interest to me, at least. I think I'll go over it at some point and see if there's anything especially funny or something notable about my beginner programming. Would be fun.

It's on python2 with libtcodpy 1.6.3.
